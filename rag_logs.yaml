originalQuestion: What is Rag all about ?
query: What are the key components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
answer: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances the quality of LLM-generated responses. It achieves this by grounding the model in external knowledge sources. This provides the LLM's internal representation of information.

originalQuestion: What is Rag all about ?
query: How does RAG improve the performance of large language models?
answer: RAG improves LLM performance by providing quality responses with the latest information. It also reduces computing, storage, and hallucinations. The RAG model compares user queries within the vector of the knowledge library and fetches out documents with similar contexts.

originalQuestion: What is Rag all about ?
query: What are the common use cases and applications of RAG?
answer: RAG applications are numerous, allowing users to converse with data repositories. Common use cases include AI assistants for doctors, nurses, and financial analysts. Businesses can also use RAG for customer support, employee training, and developer productivity by turning manuals, videos, and logs into knowledge bases.

originalQuestion: Implementation of HyDE apporach ?
query: What are the specific steps involved in implementing the HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) approach?
answer: The HyDE approach involves constructing a hypothetical document or answer from the user query using the LLM's inference capabilities. This hypothetical document, when embedded, is designed to be closer to the relevant document chunks in the embedding space. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the base model's pre-training and its relevance to the specific domain.

originalQuestion: Implementation of HyDE apporach ?
query: How can I generate hypothetical documents for the HyDE approach?
answer: To generate hypothetical documents for HyDE, you can zero-shot instruct an instruction-following language model like InstructGPT. This model generates a document that captures relevance patterns but may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder encodes the document into an embedding vector.

originalQuestion: Implementation of HyDE apporach ?
query: What are the different methods for encoding the hypothetical documents and the original query in HyDE?
answer: In HyDE, the hypothetical document is encoded using an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder like Contriever. This encoder transforms the document into an embedding vector. This vector is then used to find similar real documents in the corpus embedding space based on vector similarity.

originalQuestion: Tell me about HyDE from conclusion ?
query: What is HyDE (Hypothetical Explanations) in the context of large language models?
answer: HyDE (Hypothetical Explanations) uses a Language Learning Model to create a theoretical document in response to a query. It then transforms this document into an embedding vector to find similar documents in a vector database, focusing on answer-to-answer embedding similarity rather than query-to-answer similarity. However, HyDE may not be effective if the subject is unfamiliar to the language model, potentially leading to incorrect information.

originalQuestion: Tell me about HyDE from conclusion ?
query: How does HyDE improve reasoning or performance in LLMs?
answer: HyDE uses a Language Learning Model to create a hypothetical answer to a query and then converts this answer into an embedding vector to find similar documents in a vector database. This method focuses on answer-to-answer embedding similarity rather than query-to-answer similarity. HyDE's performance is robust and matches well-tuned retrievers in tasks like web search, QA, and fact verification.

originalQuestion: Tell me about HyDE from conclusion ?
query: What are the limitations of using HyDE in LLMs?
answer: HyDE may not consistently produce good results and can generate incorrect information if the subject is unfamiliar to the language model. This is because HyDE relies on creating a hypothetical answer with the help of an LLM and then searches for a match. Despite this limitation, HyDE represents a significant advancement in retrieval techniques.

originalQuestion: Explain HyDE in RAG Techniques ?
HypotheticalDoc: HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique that addresses the challenge of semantic mismatch between a user's query and the relevant documents in a knowledge base. Instead of directly embedding the user's query, HyDE first uses a language model to generate a hypothetical document that answers the query. This hypothetical document, which captures the semantic intent of the query, is then embedded, and the resulting embedding is used to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base. The retrieved documents, along with the original query, are then fed into a language model to generate the final answer. By embedding a hypothetical answer rather than the query itself, HyDE can often retrieve more relevant documents, leading to improved RAG performance, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced queries.
answer: HyDE creates a hypothetical answer using a language model and then searches embeddings for a match. This approach performs answer-to-answer embedding similarity search, unlike the query-to-answer search in traditional RAG. However, HyDE may not consistently produce good results, especially if the subject is unfamiliar to the language model.
