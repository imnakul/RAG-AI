originalQuestion: What is Rag all about ?
query: What are the key components of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
answer: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances the quality of LLM-generated responses. It achieves this by grounding the model in external knowledge sources. This provides the LLM's internal representation of information.

originalQuestion: What is Rag all about ?
query: How does RAG improve the performance of large language models?
answer: RAG improves LLM performance by providing quality responses with the latest information. It also reduces computing, storage, and hallucinations. The RAG model compares user queries within the vector of the knowledge library and fetches out documents with similar contexts.

originalQuestion: Implementation of HyDE apporach ?
query: What are the specific steps involved in implementing the HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) approach?
answer: The HyDE approach involves constructing a hypothetical document or answer from the user query using the LLM's inference capabilities. This hypothetical document, when embedded, is designed to be closer to the relevant document chunks in the embedding space. The effectiveness of this approach depends on the base model's pre-training and its relevance to the specific domain.

originalQuestion: Implementation of HyDE apporach ?
query: How can I generate hypothetical documents for the HyDE approach?
answer: To generate hypothetical documents for HyDE, you can zero-shot instruct an instruction-following language model like InstructGPT. This model generates a document that captures relevance patterns but may contain false details. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder encodes the document into an embedding vector.

originalQuestion: Implementation of HyDE apporach ?
query: What are the different methods for encoding the hypothetical documents and the original query in HyDE?
answer: In HyDE, the hypothetical document is encoded using an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder like Contriever. This encoder transforms the document into an embedding vector. This vector is then used to find similar real documents in the corpus embedding space based on vector similarity.

originalQuestion: Tell me about HyDE from conclusion ?
query: What is HyDE (Hypothetical Explanations) in the context of large language models?
answer: HyDE (Hypothetical Explanations) uses a Language Learning Model to create a theoretical document in response to a query. It then transforms this document into an embedding vector to find similar documents in a vector database, focusing on answer-to-answer embedding similarity rather than query-to-answer similarity. However, HyDE may not be effective if the subject is unfamiliar to the language model, potentially leading to incorrect information.

originalQuestion: Tell me about HyDE from conclusion ?
query: How does HyDE improve reasoning or performance in LLMs?
answer: HyDE uses a Language Learning Model to create a hypothetical answer to a query and then converts this answer into an embedding vector to find similar documents in a vector database. This method focuses on answer-to-answer embedding similarity rather than query-to-answer similarity. HyDE's performance is robust and matches well-tuned retrievers in tasks like web search, QA, and fact verification.

originalQuestion: Tell me about HyDE from conclusion ?
query: What are the limitations of using HyDE in LLMs?
answer: HyDE may not consistently produce good results and can generate incorrect information if the subject is unfamiliar to the language model. This is because HyDE relies on creating a hypothetical answer with the help of an LLM and then searches for a match. Despite this limitation, HyDE represents a significant advancement in retrieval techniques.

originalQuestion: Explain HyDE in RAG Techniques ?
HypotheticalDoc: HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique that addresses the challenge of semantic mismatch between a user's query and the relevant documents in a knowledge base. Instead of directly embedding the user's query, HyDE first uses a language model to generate a hypothetical document that answers the query. This hypothetical document, which captures the semantic intent of the query, is then embedded, and the resulting embedding is used to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base. The retrieved documents, along with the original query, are then fed into a language model to generate the final answer. By embedding a hypothetical answer rather than the query itself, HyDE can often retrieve more relevant documents, leading to improved RAG performance, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced queries.
answer: HyDE creates a hypothetical answer using a language model and then searches embeddings for a match. This approach performs answer-to-answer embedding similarity search, unlike the query-to-answer search in traditional RAG. However, HyDE may not consistently produce good results, especially if the subject is unfamiliar to the language model.

originalQuestion: Explain Hyde ?
hypotheticalDoc: Hyde is the alter ego of Dr. Henry Jekyll in Robert Louis Stevenson's novella, *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*. He represents the dark, repressed aspects of Jekyll's personality, embodying pure evil and lacking any sense of morality or conscience. Hyde is physically smaller and deformed compared to Jekyll, reflecting his underdeveloped and purely malevolent nature. He indulges in violent and immoral acts, giving free rein to the desires and impulses that Jekyll keeps hidden. Ultimately, Hyde's existence reveals the duality of human nature and the destructive consequences of suppressing one's darker side.
RESPONSE: HyDE uses a Language Learning Model, like ChatGPT, to create a theoretical document when responding to a query. It changes the theoretical document into an embedding vector to locate similar documents in a vector database. It focuses on answer-to-answer embedding similarity and performs well in web search, QA, and fact verification.

hypotheticalDoc: HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings) is a RAG technique that addresses the challenge of semantic mismatch between the query and the relevant documents. Instead of directly embedding the user's query, HyDE first uses a language model to generate a hypothetical document that answers the query. This hypothetical document, which is expected to contain information relevant to the query, is then embedded. The embedding of this hypothetical document is used to retrieve relevant documents from the knowledge base. The rationale behind HyDE is that the hypothetical document, even if not perfectly accurate, will likely share semantic similarities with the relevant documents, leading to better retrieval performance compared to directly using the query embedding. This retrieved context, along with the original query, is then fed into the LLM to generate the final answer.
